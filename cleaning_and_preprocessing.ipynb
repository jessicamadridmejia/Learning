You give the library the input, the library does its job, and it gives you the output you need. There are tons of libraries available, but three are essential libraries in Python. You’ll pretty much wind up using them every time. The three most popular libraries when you’re working with Python are **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas**. Numpy is the library you’ll need for all things mathematical. Since your code is going to run on math, you’re going to use this one. Matplotlib (specifically Matplotlib.pyplot) is the library you’ll want if you’re going to make charts. Pandas is the best tool available for importing and managing datasets. Pandas and Numpy are basically essential for data preprocessing.\n",
